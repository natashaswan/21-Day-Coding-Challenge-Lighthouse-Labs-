Instructions
(This challenge is worth 5 points)

Your task is to create a function that will take in an array of weather objects and will return a rounded average of the wind speed.

Since we work with an unknown amount of entries, you will need to calculate the average wind speed using loops.

Examples
Input:

    const exampleEntries = [
      { 
        temperature:0, 
        weather:"sunny", 
        windDirection: "NNE", 
        windSpeed:24
      },
      { 
        temperature:10, 
        weather:"cloudy", 
        windDirection: "NNE", 
        windSpeed:9 
      }
    ] 
    
Output:

    17
    SOLUTION
    
    function averageWindSpeed(weatherEntries){
//creating an rray to store windSpeed values
const arr = [];
//itirating through the weatherEntries array
for (let i of weatherEntries) {
//checking if the weatherEntries object has the windSpeed property
  if (i.windSpeed){
//if yes, pushing the windSpeed values into the "arr"
    arr.push(i.windSpeed)
  }
} 
//checking if the arr has more than 2 values 
if (arr.length >= 2) {
//if yes, calculating the average of the values added to the array 
const avg = Math.round(arr.reduce((total, num)=>total+num)/arr.length);
//and returning the average
return avg
  } else {
//if the array only has one value, we are returnng this value
    return "No average can be calculated. WindSpeed is:" + arr
  }
}
