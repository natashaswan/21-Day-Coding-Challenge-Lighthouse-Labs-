DAY 9

Instructions
(This challenge is worth 5 points)

Your task is to create a function that will take in an array representing the roster of astronauts, and return an array containing the jobs of each astronaut as a string.

In other terms, for each astronaut of the roster, you want to take the job and add it to a list, then return said list.

Examples
Input:

    const exampleRoster = [
      {
        ...
        job:"Shuttle DJ"
      },
      {
        ...
        job:"Space Cook"
      }
    ] 
    
Output:

    ["Shuttle DJ", "Space Cook"]
    
    SOLUTION
    function listAstronautJobs(roster){
  //creating an array to store jobs
  const jobsArr = [];
  //looping through the roster array of objects
  for (let i of roster){
    //checking if the object has a "job" property
      if (i.hasOwnProperty('job')){
      //creatig a new variable to store  the value of the "job" property 
      let job = (i["job"]);
      //pushing the vaue to the new array
      jobsArr.push(job);
      } 
       
     }
  return jobsArr;
}


//this code works fine in my console too. however here, it says my array returns objects instead of strings.

// const listAstronautJobs = (roster) => {
//   const jobsArr = roster.filter(item => item["job"]);
//   return jobsArr;
  
// }
