DAY 18
Instructions
(This challenge is worth 10 points)

Your task is to write a function that will take in an array of lunch choices (strings) and return the choice as a string with the most votes.

There is always two lunch choices, and always an odd number of astronauts!

Examples
Input:

    const listOfChoices = [
      "Chicken Dinner",
      "Chicken Dinner",
      "Chicken Dinner",
      "Ice Cream Sandwich", 
      "Ice Cream Sandwich"
    ]
Output:

    Chicken Dinner
    
    SOLUTION
    
const chooseLunchWinner = (listOfChoices) => {
  //declairing two objects to store the nunber of votes and the name of dinner choice
  let firstChoice = {
      numOfVotes: 0,
      choice: ""
    };
  let secondChoice = {
      numOfVotes: 0,
      choice: ""
    };
  
  //itirating through the listOfChoices array
  for (let i = 0; i <= listOfChoices.length; i++){
  //using the filter method to count the number of votes for the first choice in the listOfChoices and store it in the object
     firstChoice.numOfVotes = listOfChoices.filter((e)=>e===listOfChoices[i]).length;
  //storing the choice itself in the object
     firstChoice.choice = listOfChoices[i];
     
  //when a different choice from the first one is found, we count the number of votes for that choice and store it in the object 
     if (listOfChoices[i] !== listOfChoices[i+1]){
        secondChoice.numOfVotes = listOfChoices.filter((e)=>e===listOfChoices[i+1]).length;
  //storing the choice itself in the object
        secondChoice.choice = listOfChoices[i+1];
  //we don't need to continue itirating so breaking from the loop
        break
     }
  

   } if (firstChoice.numOfVotes > secondChoice.numOfVotes){
      return firstChoice.choice
  } else {
      return secondChoice.choice
  }
}
