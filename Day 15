DAY 15

Instructions
(This challenge is worth 20 points)

Your task is to write a function that will take in a launch date and a mission name as strings. Calculate the difference between two dates in days and return an object containing the name of the mission and a rounded day difference.

A part of the code has been written for you, and it is important that it stays the same for the tests to work out.

Examples
Input:

    const launchDate = "2021-12-12"
    const fakeToday = "2021-12-01"
    const missionName = "Moon visit"
    
Output:

    {
      missionName = "Moon visit",
      daysRemaining = 11
    }
    
 SOLUTION
 function timeRemaining(launchDate, missionName, fakeToday){
  
  const today = fakeToday || new Date() // Do not alter this line!
  
  //parsing the string representations of the dates
  launchDate = Date.parse(launchDate);
  fakeToday = Date.parse(fakeToday);
  
  //Date.parse method returns dates in milliseconds, creating a new variable to help convert milliseconds into days
  const _MS_PER_DAY = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
  
  //calculating the difference between the dates
  const daysRemaining = Math.floor((launchDate - fakeToday)/_MS_PER_DAY);
  
  //creating a new object
  let resultObj = {};
  
  //assigning properties to the object
  resultObj.missionName = missionName;
  resultObj.daysRemaining = daysRemaining;
  return resultObj;
  
}
