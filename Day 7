Your task is to write a function that takes in the temperature, weather condition, wind speed, and direction as parameters and store them inside a structure that holds each value as properties.

There's a small and important detail for this one, you must convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and convert the wind speed from miles/hour to meters/second, and round both of them before storing them.

The information that LARRY gave you about temperature conversions are in the hint section.

Examples
Input:

    const temperature = 32
    const condition = "Sunny with small clouds"
    const windSpeed = 20
    const windDirection = "NNE
    
Output:

    {
      temperature:0,
      windSpeed:9,
      windDirection:"NNE",
      condition:"Sunny with small clouds"
    }
    
    SOLUTION 
    

function storeWeatherConditions(temperature, condition, windSpeed, windDirection){
    //converting the tmp to C
    const convTemp = Math.round((temperature - 32) * 5/9);
    //converting the windSpeed to m/s
    const convWindSpeed = Math.round(windSpeed / 2.237);
    //creating a new objec to store the weather conditions
    const obj = {};
    //assigning key-value pairs to the object
    obj.temperature = convTemp;
    obj.windSpeed = convWindSpeed;
    obj.windDirection = windDirection;
    obj.condition = condition;
    
    return obj;
};
